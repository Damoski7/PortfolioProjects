This project is a job simulation hosted by Forage in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group's tech build and design unit, BCGX. In this project I, developed an
AI-powered chatbot using Python and Flask to analyze and provide insights from 10-K and 10-Q reports, extracting data directly from the SEC EDGAR database 
via web scraping and integrating rule-based logic for user-friendly financial analysis.

1. The Problem:
Analyzing complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports can be time-consuming and difficult for users without a finance background. There was a need for an AI-powered chatbot to extract key insights and present them in a user-friendly format.

2. The Hypothesis:
By leveraging Python and rule-based logic, a chatbot could be developed to automate the extraction and interpretation of SEC filings, making financial analysis more accessible and efficient.

3. The Approach:

Developed a chatbot using Python and Flask, integrating predefined query responses using if-else logic.
Utilized pandas for data manipulation and web scraping to extract financial data directly from the SEC EDGAR database.
Designed the chatbot to provide structured insights, helping users navigate financial reports easily.
4. The Outcome:

Created a functional AI-powered chatbot capable of answering predefined financial queries based on 10-K and 10-Q reports.
Improved the accessibility of complex financial data by automating data extraction and analysis.
Gained hands-on experience with Python programming, Flask development, and financial data interpretation in a real-world simulation.
