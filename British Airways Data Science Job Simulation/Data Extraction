## Data Collection
In this phase we will collect the customer ratings data from the airline quality website called [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). We will collect data about airline ratings, seat ratings and lounge experience ratings from this website. 

#imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests 

#create an empty list to collect all reviews
reviews  = []

#create an empty list to collect rating stars
stars = []

#create an empty list to collect date
date = []

#create an empty list to collect country the reviewer is from
country = []


for i in range(1, 36):
    page = requests.get(f"https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/page/{i}/?sortby=post_date%3ADesc&pagesize=100")
    
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html5")
    
    for item in soup.find_all("div", class_="text_content"):
        reviews.append(item.text)
    
    for item in soup.find_all("div", class_ = "rating-10"):
        try:
            stars.append(item.span.text)
        except:
            print(f"Error on page {i}")
            stars.append("None")
            
    #date
    for item in soup.find_all("time"):
        date.append(item.text)
        
    #country
    for item in soup.find_all("h3"):
        country.append(item.span.next_sibling.text.strip(" ()"))


#check the length of total reviews extracted
len(reviews)

len(country)

#check the length 
stars = stars[:3418]

#create  a dataframe from these collected lists of data
df = pd.DataFrame({"reviews":reviews,"stars": stars, "date":date, "country": country})
df.head()
df.shape

### Now let's export the data into a csv format
import os
cwd = os.getcwd()
df.to_csv(cwd+ "/BA_reviews.csv")
