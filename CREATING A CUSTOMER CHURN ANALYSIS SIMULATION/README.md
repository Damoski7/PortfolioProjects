This project is a job simulation hosted by Forage in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group. In this project I completed a customer churn analysis simulation for XYZ Analytics, leveraging Python
and data visualization to optimize a random forest model with 85% accuracy, and delivering actionable insights through an executive summary for strategic decision-making.
