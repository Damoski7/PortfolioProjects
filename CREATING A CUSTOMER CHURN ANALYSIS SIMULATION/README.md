This project is a job simulation hosted by Forage in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group. In this project I completed a customer churn analysis simulation for a startup, leveraging Python
and data visualization to optimize a random forest model with 85% accuracy, and delivering actionable insights through an executive summary for strategic decision-making.

1. The Problem:
A startup faced challenges in predicting customer churn, making it difficult to implement proactive retention strategies. There was a need for a data-driven approach to identify key factors influencing churn and optimize decision-making.

2. The Hypothesis:
By analyzing customer data and leveraging machine learning, a predictive model could be developed to accurately forecast churn, enabling the company to take strategic actions to improve retention.

3. The Approach:

Identified key client data and outlined a structured investigation strategy for churn analysis.
Conducted data analysis and preprocessing using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.
Utilized data visualization techniques to interpret trends and gain meaningful insights.
Built and optimized a random forest model, achieving 85% accuracy in predicting churn.
Summarized findings in a concise executive report with actionable recommendations for the Associate Director.
4. The Outcome:

Developed a highly accurate predictive model, enabling the startup to identify at-risk customers early.
Provided data-driven insights to support customer retention strategies and reduce churn.
Delivered a professional executive summary, empowering leadership with clear, actionable recommendations for strategic decision-making
